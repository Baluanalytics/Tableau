** Sales Insight Dashboard on Tableau**

I am excited to share my latest project - the Sales Insight dashboard. Thanks to the invaluable guidance from Dhaval Patel on his YouTube channel codebasics, I was able to create a powerful data visualization tool.

üî∏Ô∏è Problem Statement

Atliq Hardware, a leading computer hardware and peripheral devices company, faced a significant decline in sales despite having access to data from all offices. As the Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, I was determined to understand the root causes behind this decline.

üî∏Ô∏è Solution

To tackle this challenge, I embarked on an in-depth analysis of the data, leading to the creation of the Sales Insight Dashboard. This comprehensive dashboard allowed us to answer crucial questions and gain valuable insights:

üìà Key Insights from the Dashboard
